This document will walk you through the design decisions and structure of the updated <SwmPath>[README.md](/README.md)</SwmPath> file. The purpose of this README is to guide users in creating a personalized intensive course using a chatbot. The document is structured to be visually appealing and follows best practices for clarity and engagement.

We will cover:

1. The overall objective and structure of the course.
2. The step-by-step breakdown of modules and learning objectives.
3. The integration of interactive elements and assessments.
4. The use of feedback and supplementary resources.
5. The framework for prompting the chatbot effectively.

# Course objective and structure

<SwmSnippet path="/README.md" line="10">

---

The main objective is to create a personalized intensive course that takes the user from zero knowledge to expert level in a chosen subject. The course is broken down into modules with clear learning objectives, interactive lessons, and assessments.

```
Objective: Create a personalized 2-day intensive course to take me from 0 knowledge to expert level in a chosen subject.

Instructions:

Design and deliver a complete learning experience by breaking the course into modules, providing clear learning objectives, interactive lessons, and assessments. Teach each module step-by-step, integrating practical exercises, discussions, and multimedia resources.

Subject: [Insert subject you want to learn here]
```

# Audience and duration

<SwmSnippet path="/README.md" line="18">

---

The course is designed for the user, taking into account their current knowledge level and learning preferences. The duration is set to allow for an intensive learning experience, enabling the user to choose the timeframe they prefer.

```
<aside>
ðŸ’¡

Fill in your subject of choice 

</aside>

Audience: Me ([Describe your current knowledge level, e.g., beginner, no prior experience, some familiarity]).
```

</SwmSnippet>

# Learning goals

<SwmSnippet path="/README.md" line="45">

---

By the end of the course, the user should have an expert-level understanding and practical skills in the chosen subject. The goals are clearly defined to ensure measurable outcomes.

```
Goal: By the end of this course, I should have expert-level understanding and practical skills in [subject].

<aside>
ðŸ’¡

Put your subject and more information about how you want to use that skill if you would like. 

</aside>
```

# Course structure

<SwmSnippet path="/README.md" line="54">

---

The course is structured into several steps, starting with an introduction module that outlines the course structure, learning outcomes, and expectations.

```
Structure the Course as Follows:

Step 1: Introduction Module

1. Explain the course structure, learning outcomes, and expectations.
2. Provide an overview of the subject and its real-world applications.

Step 2: Main Modules
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

# Main modules and content delivery

<SwmSnippet path="/README.md" line="63">

---

Content is divided into logical modules, progressing from foundational concepts to expert-level topics. Each module includes learning objectives, content delivery with multimedia, practical exercises, and interactive elements.

```
1. Divide the content into logical modules, starting with foundational concepts and advancing to expert-level topics.
2. For each module:
- Learning Objectives: Define 3-5 measurable goals.
- Content Delivery:
- Teach core concepts with clear explanations and real-world examples.
- Include multimedia where applicable (e.g., diagrams, videos, or links).
- Practical Exercises: Provide hands-on tasks or scenarios to apply the concepts.
- Interactive Elements: Include discussion prompts or reflective questions.
```

# Assessments and projects

<SwmSnippet path="/README.md" line="72">

---

Assessments are integrated to test understanding, with quizzes and assignments for each module. Mid-course and final projects are designed to evaluate mastery of the subject.

```
Step 3: Assessments and Projects

1. Assess Understanding: Create quizzes or assignments for each module to test my knowledge.
2. Mid-Course Project: Design an assignment that integrates concepts from the first half of the course.
3. Final Project: Create a capstone task that evaluates my mastery of the subject.

Step 4: Advanced Modules
```

</SwmSnippet>

# Advanced modules and supplementary resources

<SwmSnippet path="/README.md" line="80">

---

Advanced modules build on earlier concepts with complex exercises and discussions. Supplementary resources are provided for further learning, including textbooks and online materials.

```
1. Build on earlier concepts with advanced-level content and challenges.
2. Include complex practical exercises and deeper discussions.
3. Assess learning with case studies, problem-solving tasks, or detailed projects.

Step 5: Supplementary Resources

1. Provide a list of recommended textbooks, online materials, and tools for further learning.
2. Include a glossary of key terms introduced during the course.
```

# Feedback and completion

<SwmSnippet path="/README.md" line="89">

---

Opportunities for feedback are included, along with a customizable course completion certificate. The teaching plan emphasizes a conversational style and adaptability based on user engagement.

```
Step 6: Feedback and Completion

1. Include opportunities for me to provide feedback on the course experience.
2. Offer a customizable course completion certificate based on defined success criteria.

Teaching Plan

1. Teach each module in a conversational style, pausing to confirm understanding and answer questions.
2. Provide clear transitions between modules, summarizing key takeaways before moving forward.
3. Adjust pacing and depth based on my responses and engagement.
```

# Prompting framework

<SwmSnippet path="/README.md" line="180">

---

A generalized follow-up prompt framework is provided to guide users in interacting with the chatbot. This includes starting modules, reviewing content, applying practical exercises, and seeking feedback.

```
## Generalized Follow-Up Prompt Framework

Here's how you can prompt the chatbot for any subject while maintaining flexibility and depth:

### Starting or Moving Forward

**Prompt Options:**
